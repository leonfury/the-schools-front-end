                <p>
                    Many may wonder if public schools are still right for their kids, it is our belief that International and private schools are the future-proof alternative for the ever advancing, competitive, and globalizing future. In ensuring that our next generation could meet such demand of globalization and the future beyond, we need to take a step further.
                    <br><br>
                    Here in TheSchool.Asia, we believe that children of the future must be globally competitive, culturally matured and accepting, they need to be exposed to the world at large and lastly, they need to know how to study smart and work smart, these are the characters which international schools can instil into our children, thus this is why international schools are the engine that will drive us forward into the future.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="text-title-highlight">Our Vision and Beliefs and Our Team</h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from archiving the best international and private schools available in Malaysia, we seek to ensure that the modern day parents are equipped with the best information there is to make the smartest decision for their children, to do so  our team has to be specially equipped as well, we are constantly looking for additions for our team.
                    <br><br>
                    Much like the meaning behind our Logo (which represents the Chinese character “ 众 ” which meant Masses or population at large) our team has to be diverse in terms of their culture, age, skills and experience, and more so, our logo represents the vision which we see that is to provide high quality education for all levels of income group, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity or learning capability, QUALITY EDUCATION FOR EVERYONE!
